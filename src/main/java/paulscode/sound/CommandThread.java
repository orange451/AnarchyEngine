/**
 * The CommandThread class is designed to move all command processing into a
 * single thread to be run in the background and avoid conflicts between
 * threads.  Commands are processed in the order that they were queued.  The
 * arguements for each command are stored in a
 * {@link paulscode.sound.CommandObject CommandObject}.  The Command Queue is
 * located in the {@link paulscode.sound.SoundSystem SoundSystem} class.
 * Calling kill() stops the thread, and this should be immediatly followed
 * by a call to interrupt() to wake up the thread so it may end.  This class
 * also checks for temporary sources that are finished playing, and removes
 * them.
 *
 * NOTE: The command thread is created automatically by the sound system, so it
 * is unlikely that the user would ever need to use this class.
