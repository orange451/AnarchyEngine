/**
 * The Channel class is the base class which can be extended for 
 * library-specific channels.  It is also used in the "no-sound" library.  
 * A channel is a reserved sound-card voice through which sources are played 
 * back.  Channels can be either streaming channels or normal (non-streaming) 
 * ones.  For consistant naming conventions, each sub-class should have the 
 * name prefix "Channel".
